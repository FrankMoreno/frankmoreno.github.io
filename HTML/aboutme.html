        <p> hello! my name is Thuy-Mi Le. you can view my </br>
          professional introduction/elevator pitch</br>
          in the video above.</br>

          this website is a professional online portfolio to</br>
          highlight my personality, skills, and accomplishments.</br>
          while my interests and experiences may seem</br>
          scattered, with little direction, I pride myself in my</br>
          variety. I may not know exactly who or what I want</br>
          to be, but I do know that whoever and whatever</br>
          I become, Iâ€™ll be doing a pretty great job at it.</br>

          thank you for browsing around my portfolio.</br>
          if you would like to connect with me,</br>
          make sure to visit my contact page.</br>
