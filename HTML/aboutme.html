        <p> hello! my name is Thuy-Mi Le. you can view my </br>
          professional introduction/elevator pitch in the video above.</br></br>

          this website is a professional online portfolio to highlight my </br>
          personality, skills, and accomplishments. while my interests and </br>
          experiences may seem scattered, with little direction, I pride myself</br>
          in my variety. I may not know exactly who or what I want to be,</br>
          but I do know that whoever and whatever I become, Iâ€™ll be </br>
          doing a pretty great job at it.</br></br>

          thank you for browsing around my portfolio. if you would like to </br>
          connect with me, make sure to visit my contact page.</br>
